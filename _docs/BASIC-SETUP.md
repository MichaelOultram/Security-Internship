# Basic Development Setup Guide

This is a quick guide on how to get started with puppet and developing puppet modules.

## Requirements

- Vagrant
- Virtualbox

## Installing puppet-sandbox

1. Install the required software

2. Navigate to a working directory and clone the [puppet-sandbox](https://github.com/martialblog/puppet-sandbox) repository using `git clone https://github.com/martialblog/puppet-sandbox`.

3. [puppet-sandbox](https://github.com/martialblog/puppet-sandbox) creates three virtual machines to play around with but we only need one to test our modules. To change this open the `Vagrantfile` and change this
```
puppet_nodes = [
  	{:hostname => 'puppet',  :ip => '172.16.32.10', :box => 'precise64', :fwdhost => 8140, :fwdguest => 8140, :ram => 512},
  	{:hostname => 'client1', :ip => '172.16.32.11', :box => 'precise64'},
  	{:hostname => 'client2', :ip => '172.16.32.12', :box => 'precise64'},
]
```
to this
```
puppet_nodes = [
  	{:hostname => 'puppet',  :ip => '172.16.32.10', :box => 'precise64', :fwdhost => 8140, :fwdguest => 8140, :ram => 512},
]
```

4. Run the command `vagrant up` inside the puppet-sandbox folder. This could take a while as it should download the virtual machine from the internet and start it up.

5. If everything was successful then you can run the command `vagrant ssh` to get inside the newly created virtual machine.

## Adding our modules

1. Now that you have a working puppet setup, it might be worth checking out the [Vagrant guide](VAGRANT.md) that I wrote. Before continuing with this guide halt the virtual machine using `vagrant halt`.

2. Navigate inside the `puppet-sandbox/modules` directory and initialise the folder as a git repository: `git init`

3. Set the remote origin to this repository: `git remote add origin "https://github.com/MichaelOultram/Security-Internship.git"`

4. Pull the repository: `git pull origin master`

5. Set the default remote to origin `git push --set-upstream origin master`

6. You should be all setup to start testing the modules in this repository as well as [creating your own modules](PUPPET.md).
