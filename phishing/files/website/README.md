# Website

This module creates a phishing-friendly environment for the purpose of learning how to create an attack/deffence in two different methods:
- Web/Email
- Macros (VBA)

## Requirements

- PuppetDocker module;
- Metasploit module;
- Mailserver module;
- maestrodev-rvm module;

## How to use

This module provides a web server and a email server for an attacker to breach into the Worklink company. After searching the website for its vulnerabilities the attacker can initiate various attacks.

There are 3 attacks in total one can perform, but how do they work is something to be found out.

The attacker may want to use the Metasploit which is pre-installed.

## Victims

The victims behave as different users who can view email and run attachments. Each victim has different vulnerabilities and defences.

## Goal

The goal of this challenge is to get access in all 3 vulnerable accounts.
