          <p>Worklink is currently the leading hiring platform in Birmingham.</p>
          <p>Often regarded as England's 'second city', Birmingham is the most populous city in the UK outside of London. Located in the West Midlands, in 2014, the city was estimated to have around 1.1 million inhabitants. This page contains details of recruitment agencies in Birmingham - as well as the neighbouring towns of Smethwick and Oldbury - and will be of use whether you are seeking new employment or candidates to fill positions within your organisation  </p>
          <p>Major employers in the Birmingham area</p>
          <p>As with most British cities, one of the largest employers in Birmingham is the local council - which is also the largest local authority in Europe. In the past, the area was known for the production of vehicles - with the Longbridge Plant having been associated with brands such as MG Rover and British Leyland. Following the collapse of MG Rover, the motor industry in the area suffered greatly, with many redundancies, but employers such as Jaguar remain in the area, employing many people.</p>
          <p>Other major employers around Birmingham include the National Express Group, which has its head office there, as well as the Finance Industry - Lloyds Banking Group and The Royal Bank of Scotland both employing large numbers of people. Kraft Foods (owners of Cadbury) also have a head office in Birmingham, located at the historic Bournville site.</p>
          <p>As you can see from this page, the Birmingham area is home to a large number of recruitment agencies - ranging from large-scale generalists to niche-market specialists. Whether you are looking for a temporary or permanent appointment, these agencies represent the best way to find what you need. Recruitment in Birmingham covers the whole spectrum - right up to executive headhunting services, who will search and select for candidates at the very highest levels.</p>
