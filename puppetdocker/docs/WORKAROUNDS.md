# Workarounds
The current state of this module is not perfect, but it is generally in a working state. However there are a few things that could go wrong and here are some of the current workarounds.

* DNS not resolving
* fixip task broken in puppet
* Gateway containers not forwarding ports.
* Rebuilding a single container
