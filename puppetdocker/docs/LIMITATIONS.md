# Limitations

As with everything, there are some limitations. Some of puppetdocker's
limitations could be solved in the future and is therefore also included in
[FUTURE.md](./FUTURE.md).

-   Cannot have two cidr's overlapping
-   Containers have the permissions to change their network settings
-   Containers assume xxx.xxx.xxx.1 ip address is the Gateway
-   The host virtual machine ends up with many network interfaces.
-   Puppet can not be run more than once.
-   Can not restore a container fully with more than one network interface
-   Must use a 64 bit operating system
